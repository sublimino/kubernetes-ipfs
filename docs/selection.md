# Selection Specification

The DSL selection feature chooses nodes on which to run commands.
In addition to the `on_node` / `end_node` option each step can alternatively take
a selection object which allows tests to specify nodes in 2 major ways, ranges
and percentages.

## Ranges
Select nodes by range:
  - specify order = `{SEQUENTIAL, RANDOM}`
  - Similar to `on_node` / `end_node` when specified sequentially
  - When specified randomly choose a number of random nodes
     
### Example1: run a command on nodes 1 through 10 inclusive

``` 
selection:
        range:
          order: SEQUENTIAL
          start: 1
          end: 10
```

### Example2: run a command on 5 random nodes

```selection:
        range:
          order: RANDOM
          number: 5
```
## Percents 
Select nodes by percent
      - specify order = {SEQUENTIAL, RANDOM}
      - When specifying sequential choose start node and percent
      - When specifying random just choose percent
      - If a command draws nodes at random it will not repeat node indexes
      e.g running at random on 100 percent will run the command on all nodes
      - If percentages do not correspond to whole numbers then the ceiling of 
      the percentage is used to specify the number of nodes to run


### Example3: run a command on a range of nodes equal to 30 percent of the total nodes and starting on the second node

```selection:
        percent: 
          order: SEQUENTIAL
          start: 2 
          percent: 30
```

### Example4: run a command on 55 percent of randomly indexed nodes

```selection:
        percent: 
          order: RANDOM
          percent: 55
```


# Subset specification and usage

- Just as they can be specified with respect to the entire collection 
of nodes as shown above, percents and ranges can be specified with 
respect to a partition of the nodes.  
- Partitions are specified in the config header of the 
test file.  To specify the partition of nodes into subsets for a
given test, we use the subset_partition structure. 
- The first choice to make is whether to divide the nodes up evenly or 
into specified chunks by percentage (EVEN vs WEIGHTED)  
- The second choice is whether nodes should fill partitions 
sequentially, or indexes should be selected at random
(SEQUENTIAL vs RANDOM).

### Example5: Break the nodes into 3 subsets of different weights in order.  

- The first 10% of nodes go to subset 1
- the following 5% of nodes go to subset 2 
- the final 85% of nodes go to subset 3

```config:
   ...
     subset_partion:
       partition_type: WEIGHTED
       order: SEQUENTIAL
       percents: [10, 5, 85]
   ...
```

### Example6: Break the nodes into 8 even partitions with randomly chosen node indexes 


```config:
   ...
     subset_partion:
       partition_type: EVEN
       order: RANDOM
       number_partitions: 8
   ...

```
- Of course you could pair EVEN with SEQUENTIAL and WEIGHTED with RANDOM
  too
- Now to specify that a range or percent selection should be taken with 
  respect to a subset simply include the subset field in the top level of 
  the selection map and specify in this field a list of the desired headers

### Example7: Run a command on 10 random nodes of the 3rd partition and 10 random nodes of the 4th partition

```selection:
     subset: [3,4]
     range:
         order: RANDOM
         number: 10

```


### Example8: Run a command on 50 percent of the nodes on the 2nd partition starting from the 1st node of the 2nd partition **

```selection: 
     subset: [2]
     percent:
         order: SEQUENTIAL
         start: 1
         percent: 50
```
