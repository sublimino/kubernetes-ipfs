# Welcome to the kubernetes-ipfs cluster tests

To launch all tests execute `./runner.sh <N> <Y>`
-   N is the total number of ipfs-cluster nodes (kubernetes pods) running in the
     configuration
-   Y is the total number of pins that tests add to cluster

To launch the ipfs-cluster deployment for a given node number and
kubernetes-ipfs config* but not start running all tests, execute

`./runner.sh <N> <Y> manual`

This is useful for running individual tests

* Note: the config (./tests/config.yml) can be changed manually if different
parameters are desired between multiple tests running on the same deployment

# Cluster test initialization structure

`runner.sh` is the entrypoint starting all initialization
- parses args
- updates deployment to launch N nodes
- launches `init.sh`
- launches `config-writer.sh`
- runs kubernetes-ipfs on all tests in `./tests` folder

`init.sh` initializes the kubernetes cluster to run ipfs-cluster
- deploys monitoring
- deploys ipfs-cluster
- waits for ipfs-cluster nodes to become initialized
- adds all ipfs-cluster nodes into 1 shared ipfs-cluster
- prints info about the cluster

`config-writer.sh` writes N, Y and derived parameters to a kubernetes-ipfs config
-  used for all cluster tests
-    parses args
-    writes config values to file
      -  (due to current limitations in parameter support in testing DSL each
    combination (e.g. 4Y + N) of parameters needs to be written to config)
